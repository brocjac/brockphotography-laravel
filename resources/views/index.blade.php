                I am always there to capture natures lovely moments.
                I have been doing photography since 2015 now and still going strong.
                I started out taking pictures of my dog with my first DSLR.

                Continuing on my journey, went on with photographing a wedding in 2015 - which was a great experience! Using my prior photography knowledge, I was able to capture some great moments for the happy couple.

                I won a “superior” award in Fine Arts for district competitions in 2016 and 2017. I also was awarded “superior” in nationals for the 2016 Fine Arts convention.
                I also earned a 3rd place award for photography in a Skills USA district competition.
